# FInal-Project-

This dataset was handled with Python and R to predict the chances of the player going against a certain generation, the legendary status of a Pokémon, and whether they are in their final evolution. This was done with classification. The three research questions are: What is the final evolution prediction accuracy, the legendary prediction accuracy, and the generation accuracy? Machine learning classification models were trained and evaluated. Each model used different Pokémon attributes—such as type, base stats, height, weight, and abilities—to learn patterns that help distinguish one class from another. Feature preprocessing, such as scaling numerical values and encoding categorical features, was performed to ensure consistent model performance across both Python and R implementations.
